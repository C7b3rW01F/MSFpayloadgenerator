## Suppose I want to create a Python revershell for reverse engineering. For that purpuse I've chosen python.

## 1. Give the ip address. Note: If you want to use inside your LAN then give the Local IP here and if you want to use it over WAN then use the Forwarded IP/Tunnel IP.
## 2. Specify PORT number.
## 3. Specify the directory where you want to store the generated Malware.
## 4. Mention the file name with proper extension.
